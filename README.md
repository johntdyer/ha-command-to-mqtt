A Go application that executes system commands and publishes their results to MQTT topics with Home Assistant auto-discovery support.

## Features

- Execute custom commands at configurable intervals
- Publish command results to MQTT topics
- Home Assistant auto-discovery for automatic sensor creation
- Support for both YAML configuration and environment variables
- Configurable device classes, units, and icons for sensors
- Advanced logging with multiple formats (text, JSON, logfmt) using logrus
- SSH support for remote command execution
- Robust error handling and comprehensive logging

## Configuration

### Option 1: YAML Configuration (Recommended)

Create a `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
mqtt:
  broker: "localhost"
  port: 1883
  username: "your_username"
  password: "your_password"
  client_id: "ha-command-to-mqtt"

commands:
  - name: "CPU Temperature"
    command: "cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp"
    frequency: "30s"
    device_class: "temperature"
    unit: "Â°C"
    icon: "mdi:thermometer"

  - name: "System Uptime"
    command: "uptime -p"
    frequency: "5m"
    icon: "mdi:clock-outline"
```

### Option 2: Environment Variables

Set environment variables for configuration:

```bash
# MQTT Configuration
export MQTT_BROKER=localhost
export MQTT_PORT=1883
export MQTT_USERNAME=your_username
export MQTT_PASSWORD=your_password
export MQTT_CLIENT_ID=ha-command-to-mqtt

# Commands
export COMMAND_CPU_TEMP="cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone0/temp"
export COMMAND_CPU_TEMP_FREQUENCY=30s
export COMMAND_CPU_TEMP_DEVICE_CLASS=temperature
export COMMAND_CPU_TEMP_UNIT=Â°C
export COMMAND_CPU_TEMP_ICON=mdi:thermometer
```

## Command Configuration

Each command supports the following options:

- `name`: Display name for the sensor
- `command`: Shell command to execute
- `frequency`: How often to run the command (e.g., "30s", "5m", "1h")
- `device_class`: Home Assistant device class (optional)
- `unit`: Unit of measurement (optional)
- `icon`: Material Design Icon (optional)
- `target_host`: Target host to execute command on - "local" or SSH host name (optional, defaults to "local")
- `force_update`: Force Home Assistant to update even if value hasn't changed (optional)
- `state_class`: Home Assistant state class - "measurement", "total", "total_increasing" (optional)
- `entity_category`: Home Assistant entity category - "config", "diagnostic" (optional)
- `expire_after`: Seconds after which the sensor becomes unavailable if no update (optional)

## SSH Support (Optional)

Commands can be executed either locally or on remote hosts via SSH. **SSH configuration is completely optional** - the application works perfectly fine with only local commands.

### SSH Configuration

If you want to execute commands on remote hosts, configure SSH hosts in your `config.yaml`:

```yaml
ssh:
  hosts:
    - name: "server1"
      host: "192.168.1.100"
      port: 22
      user: "pi"
      key_path: "/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa"
      timeout: "30s"

    - name: "server2"
      host: "example.com"
      port: 2222
      user: "ubuntu"
      key_path: "/home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519"
      timeout: "10s"

    # SSH Agent authentication (no key_path needed)
    - name: "server3"
      host: "agent-server.local"
      port: 22
      user: "ubuntu"
      timeout: "30s"
```

### SSH Authentication Methods

The application supports multiple SSH authentication methods in the following priority order:

1. **Configured SSH Keys**: If `key_path` is specified in the host configuration, it will use that specific key
2. **SSH Agent**: If SSH agent is running (`ssh-agent`) and has keys loaded, it will use those keys
3. **Default SSH Keys**: Falls back to searching for keys in default locations (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`)
4. **Password Authentication**: If configured in the host settings

#### Using SSH Agent

SSH agent provides the most convenient authentication method as it doesn't require specifying key paths in your configuration:

```bash
# Start SSH agent and add your keys
eval $(ssh-agent -s)
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Verify keys are loaded
ssh-add -l

# Run the application - it will automatically use agent keys
./ha-command-to-mqtt
```

With SSH agent, your host configuration becomes simpler:

```yaml
ssh:
  hosts:
    - name: "my-server"
      host: "example.com"
      user: "ubuntu"
      # No key_path needed - will use SSH agent automatically
```

**Alternative SSH configurations:**

```yaml
# Option 1: No SSH section at all (local commands only)
mqtt:
  broker: "localhost"
  # ... other MQTT config

commands:
  - name: "Local Command"
    command: "uptime -p"
    frequency: "5m"

# Option 2: Empty SSH section (same as option 1)
mqtt:
  broker: "localhost"
  # ... other MQTT config

ssh:
  hosts: []

commands:
  - name: "Local Command"
    command: "uptime -p"
    frequency: "5m"
```

### Local and Remote Commands

Commands execute locally by default. To execute on a remote host, specify the `target_host` parameter:

```yaml
commands:
  # Local command (default behavior)
  - name: "Local CPU Usage"
    command: "top -bn1 | grep 'Cpu(s)' | awk '{print $2}'"
    frequency: "30s"

  # Explicit local command (same as above)
  - name: "Local Memory Usage"
    command: "free -m | awk 'NR==2{printf \"%.1f\", $3*100/$2}'"
    frequency: "30s"
    target_host: "local"

  # Remote command via SSH
  - name: "Remote Server Load"
    command: "uptime | awk -F'load average:' '{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}'"
    frequency: "1m"
    target_host: "server1"
    icon: "mdi:server"
```

### SSH Features

- **SSH Agent Support**: Automatically uses keys loaded in ssh-agent for seamless authentication
- **Automatic Key Detection**: If no key path is specified, the application will try SSH agent first, then common SSH key locations (`~/.ssh/id_rsa`, `~/.ssh/id_ed25519`, `~/.ssh/id_ecdsa`)
- **Connection Pooling**: SSH connections are established once and reused for multiple commands
- **Automatic Reconnection**: If an SSH connection drops, the application will automatically reconnect
- **Timeout Support**: Configure connection timeouts per host
- **Multiple Authentication**: Supports SSH agent, SSH key files, and password authentication

### Environment Variables for Remote Commands

```bash
# SSH hosts are configured in YAML, but commands can reference them
COMMAND_REMOTE_CPU=cat /proc/loadavg | awk '{print $1}'
COMMAND_REMOTE_CPU_TARGET_HOST=server1
COMMAND_REMOTE_CPU_FREQUENCY=1m
COMMAND_REMOTE_CPU_STATE_CLASS=measurement

# Local command (optional to specify)
COMMAND_LOCAL_DISK=df -h / | awk 'NR==2{print $5}' | sed 's/%//'
COMMAND_LOCAL_DISK_TARGET_HOST=local
COMMAND_LOCAL_DISK_FREQUENCY=5m
COMMAND_LOCAL_DISK_ENTITY_CATEGORY=diagnostic
COMMAND_LOCAL_DISK_FORCE_UPDATE=true
```

## Home Assistant Integration Attributes

The application supports comprehensive Home Assistant sensor attributes:

### State Classes
- `measurement`: For sensors that report current values (temperature, CPU usage)
- `total`: For sensors that report cumulative values (disk space used)
- `total_increasing`: For monotonically increasing values (network bytes sent)

### Entity Categories
- `config`: Configuration entities
- `diagnostic`: Diagnostic entities (shown in diagnostic section)

### Device Classes
Common device classes include: `battery`, `temperature`, `humidity`, `pressure`, `signal_strength`, `data_size`, `data_rate`, `duration`, `frequency`, `power`, `voltage`, `current`, `energy`, etc.

### Additional Attributes
- `force_update`: Forces Home Assistant to update even if the value hasn't changed
- `expire_after`: Number of seconds after which the sensor becomes unavailable if no new data

Example with all attributes:
```yaml
- name: "Advanced CPU Sensor"
  command: "top -bn1 | grep 'Cpu(s)' | awk '{print $2}' | sed 's/%us,//'"
  frequency: "30s"
  device_class: "battery"
  unit: "%"
  icon: "mdi:cpu-64-bit"
  state_class: "measurement"
  entity_category: "diagnostic"
  force_update: true
  expire_after: 90
```

```

## Logging

The application uses [logrus](https://github.com/sirupsen/logrus) for advanced logging capabilities.

### Log Levels

- `panic`: Highest level, logs and then calls `panic()`
- `fatal`: Logs and then calls `os.Exit(1)`
- `error`: Error messages only
- `warn`: Warning and error messages
- `info`: Standard informational logging (default)
- `debug`: Verbose logging with file names and line numbers
- `trace`: Most verbose level for detailed debugging

### Log Formats

- `text`: Human-readable text format with colors and timestamps (default)
- `json`: Structured JSON format, ideal for log aggregation systems
- `logfmt`: Key-value pairs format (key=value), uses logrus TextFormatter without colors

### Examples

```bash
# Debug level with JSON format (great for log analysis tools)
./ha-command-to-mqtt --log-level debug --log-format json

# Production setup with structured logging
./ha-command-to-mqtt --log-level info --log-format logfmt

# Development with detailed text logging
./ha-command-to-mqtt --log-level trace --log-format text
```

## Home Assistant Integration

The application automatically creates sensors in Home Assistant through MQTT discovery. Sensors will appear in Home Assistant with the device name "Command Sensors".

### MQTT Topics

- Discovery: `homeassistant/sensor/{client_id}_{sensor_name}/config`
- State: `homeassistant/sensor/{client_id}_{sensor_name}/state`
