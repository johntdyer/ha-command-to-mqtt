**Purpose**: Comprehensive code quality and security scanning

**Triggers**:
- Push to any branch
- Pull requests
- Scheduled runs (weekly)

**Scanning Tools**:

- **golangci-lint**: Go code quality and style checking
- **gosec**: Security vulnerability scanning for Go code
- **Trivy**: Container image vulnerability scanning
- **CodeQL**: Advanced semantic code analysis
- **Dependency Check**: Vulnerability scanning for dependencies
- **License Check**: License compatibility verification

### 4. Dependency Management (`dependencies.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated dependency updates and security monitoring

**Triggers**:
- Scheduled runs (daily for security, weekly for updates)
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Features**:
- Go module dependency updates
- GitHub Actions version updates
- Security vulnerability monitoring
- Automated pull request creation
- Base Docker image update notifications

### 5. Release Management (`release.yml`)

**Purpose**: Automated release creation and asset management

**Triggers**:
- Git tags matching `v*` pattern
- Manual workflow dispatch

**Assets Created**:
- Multi-platform binaries (Linux, macOS, Windows, multiple architectures)
- Home Assistant add-on packages
- Docker images
- Checksums file
- Automated changelog

## Configuration Files

### Linting Configuration

- **`.golangci.yml`**: Go linting rules and configuration

- **Quality Assurance**: Automated code quality and security checks
- **Documentation**: Automated documentation updates

### Release Management
- **Semantic Versioning**: Proper version management with git tags
- **Multi-format Releases**: Binaries, containers, and add-on packages
- **Changelog Generation**: Automated release notes from git history
- **Asset Organization**: Consistent release asset structure

### Security and Compliance
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Regular security scans and updates
- **Compliance Checking**: License and dependency compliance
- **Vulnerability Management**: Automated detection and notification
- **Supply Chain Security**: Verification of build dependencies

## Workflow Integration

### Branch Protection
The workflows integrate with GitHub branch protection rules:
- Required status checks for all workflows
- Prevent merging without successful CI
- Automated dependency updates via pull requests

### Artifact Management
- **Build Artifacts**: Temporary storage for CI builds
- **Release Assets**: Long-term storage for releases  
- **Container Images**: Multi-architecture image management
- **Add-on Packages**: Home Assistant add-on distribution

### Notification System
- **Status Badges**: README badges for workflow status
- **Pull Request Comments**: Automated feedback on PRs
- **Release Notifications**: Automated release announcements
- **Security Alerts**: Immediate notification of security issues

## Performance Optimizations

### Caching Strategy
- **Go Modules**: Cached between workflow runs
- **Docker Layers**: Efficient layer caching for builds
- **Build Dependencies**: Cached toolchain installations

### Parallel Execution
- **Matrix Builds**: Parallel builds for multiple platforms
- **Concurrent Jobs**: Independent job execution
- **Efficient Resource Usage**: Optimized runner utilization

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Workflow Health
- **Success Rates**: Track workflow success/failure rates
- **Execution Time**: Monitor workflow performance
- **Resource Usage**: Optimize runner resource consumption

### Dependency Tracking
- **Automated Updates**: Regular dependency updates
- **Security Monitoring**: Continuous vulnerability scanning
